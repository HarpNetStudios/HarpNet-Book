# Chapter 1: A New Frontier

HarpNet Studios started on July 16, 2008, originally under the name of Wild Banana Inc. It was started by Zsolt Bartha (Sam Kniffer) and a group of about 3 friends.
It has since expanded to about roughly 20 people and the name was changed from Wild Banana Inc. to HarpNet and then HarpNet Studios.

Anyway, enough hard info, time to tell an interesting story. So, in late 2007 I realized that I could do whatever I put my mind to, I just needed some help.
So in early 2008 we started to work on Jaft and stuff happened.
